# Why does layout center children vertically? (2025-06-03 02:10:26)

@layout.tsx why does it center its children vertically

---

_**Assistant**_



---

The `div` element at `apps/portfolio/src/components/layout.tsx:15` has the Tailwind CSS classes `flex` and `items-center`. The `flex` class makes it a flex container, and `items-center` then centers the flex items (its children) vertically within the container. The `h-100` class likely sets the height of this `div` to 100%, which allows the vertical centering to be apparent.

I listed the contents of the `out` directory and it included the hidden files. Did you mean to view hidden files for the entire workspace, or just the `out` directory?
