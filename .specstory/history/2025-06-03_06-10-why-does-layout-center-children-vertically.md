@layout.tsx why does it center its children vertically

---

_**Assistant**_



---

The `div` element at `apps/portfolio/src/components/layout.tsx:15` has the Tailwind CSS classes `flex` and `items-center`. The `flex` class makes it a flex container, and `items-center` then centers the flex items (its children) vertically within the container. The `h-100` class likely sets the height of this `div` to 100%, which allows the vertical centering to be apparent.
