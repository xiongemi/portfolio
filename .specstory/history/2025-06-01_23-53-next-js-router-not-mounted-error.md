I see you're encountering a "NextRouter was not mounted" error in your `EditorHeader.tsx` file. This often happens when mixing `useRouter` from `next/router` (Pages Router) with `usePathname` from `next/navigation` (App Router).

I will update your `EditorHeader.tsx` file to use `useRouter` exclusively from `next/navigation`, ensuring compatibility with the Next.js App Router.

---

```diff
  
  import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
- import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'
- import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
+ import { usePathname, useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
  import FileTab from './FileTab'; 
  
```

I've updated `EditorHeader.tsx` to ensure `useRouter` is imported from `next/navigation`, aligning it with `usePathname` and the Next.js App Router. This should resolve the "NextRouter was not mounted" error. Please re-run your application to confirm the fix.
